# The Shoppies

Is a challenge project by Shopify and attempted by Felix Rioux Sabourin.

## Challenge:

Shopify has branched out into movie award shows and we need your help. Please build us an app to help manage our movie nominations for the upcoming Shoppies.
[...]
We need a webpage that can search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save their favourite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.

We'd like a simple to use interface that makes it easy to:

- Search OMDB and display the results (movies only)
- Add a movie from the search results to our nomination list
- View the list of films already nominated
- Remove a nominee from the nomination list

## Scripts

to start the project in developmnent mode:

`yarn && yarn start`
