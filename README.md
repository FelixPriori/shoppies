# The Shoppies

Is a challenge project by Shopify and attempted by Felix Rioux Sabourin.

## Prompt

> Shopify has branched out into movie award shows and we need your help. Please build us an app to help manage our movie nominations for the upcoming Shoppies.
>
> ## The Challenge
>
> We need a webpage that can search OMDB for movies, and allow the user to save their favourite films they feel should be up for nomination. When they've selected 5 nominees they should be notified they're finished.
> We'd like a simple to use interface that makes it easy to:
>
> - Search OMDB and display the results (movies only)
> - Add a movie from the search results to our nomination list
> - View the list of films already nominated
> - Remove a nominee from the nomination list
